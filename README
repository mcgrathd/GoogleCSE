GoogleCSE
=========

This extension allows you to use the Google Custom Search Engine, either in
addition to, or as a replacement of, the built in MediaWiki search.

To enabled the extension, add the following lines to your LocalSettings.php
file:

  require_once( "$IP/extensions/GoogleCSE/GoogleCSE.php" );
  $wgGoogleCSEcx = "<your CSE cx id>";

To access the page, you currently have to visit the Special:GoogleCSE special
page.

If you wish to replace the built in search with GoogleCSE, you ran add this to
your LocalSettings.php:

    $wgSpecialPages['Search'] = 'SpecialGoogleCSE';
    $wgDisableInternalSearch = true;

Note: that if you replace the internal search, you will only see results that
Google has indexed on your site
